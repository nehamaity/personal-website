    <small>I wanted to sign up for this challenge to gain some structure and post

    <small>Iâ€™ve been exposed to programming for a few years now and majored in computer 
        science in university. While I was able to finish up my degree last year and land 
        a job after graduation, there are some things I wish I did differently.</small></p>
